                            A gloomy river of clouds flooded the blue sky. Piercing wind carried the scent of death
                            as
                            eagles soared with an appetite. A plague of pigeons scrambled unceremoniously; they
                            circled
                            back
                            to the start and gathered as they were. Thrice the eagles have returned- wave after

                            their own. The mating rituals soon have been interrupted by the cold showers from the

                            Strange, winged creatures stood still in the shade of a cracked wall. Their feathers
                            were of
                            colour akin to that of wood in the rain. Their eyes were dense as the void; a
                            constellation
                            of
                            tiny specks glowed from within.
                            <br><br>
                            A child approached the creatures with a bowl of seeds. He sat with his back to the wall
                            and
                            let
                            out a breath of prayer. As he tossed a handful of seeds on the ground in front of him,
                            the
                            creatures began to move. In the midst of the crowd was a youngling. From beneath its
                            eyelids, a
                            thin layer of skin crawled out, masking the void. The creature flew up to the bowl and
                            indulged
                            itself. The rest waddled around pecking at the ground in remarkable unison.
                            <br><br>
                            Later that night, incomprehensible noises flooded the dreams of the child, turning them
                            to
                            cryptic nightmares. He woke up only to find the noises still haunting him. The source,
                            he
                            realised, was outside.
                            <br><br>
                            Motivated by curiosity and fuelled by annoyance, he moved towards the door to the
                            balcony.
                            With
                            every step, hesitance slowed him further, his curiosity grew stronger, his heart beat
                            louder.
                            <br><br>
                            An eternity passed; he turned the knob and pushed the door wide open. An obscure being
                            with
                            a
                            translucent form sat among dense clouds. A swarm of lightning traversed around it in
                            ways
                            unnatural.
                            <br><br>
                            Ripples of screeches echoed out of the dark of the night. Dense little shades moved in
                            front
                            of
                            the clouds. The winged creatures were as fast as their screeches. They moved with the
                            grace
                            of a
                            dancer and the swiftness of a fighter. The ripples of screeches collided with the swarm
                            of
                            lightning, denting the very fabric of reality around them.

                            The glass, tinted unevenly, did not open. On the other side are a great many windows

                            symmetrically on walls of unsaturated colours. I could not count them all if I had an

                            At a distance, a group of younglings, full of life, stood tall waving their hands at the
                            speeding train. I imagine they must have not seen me, for I am behind a tinted glass.
                            Would
                            it
                            have been of any consequence to return the wave?

                            The Gods painted the heavens with a symphony of colours. Never have I laid the slightest
                            glance upon a spectacle so terrifyingly breathtaking.
                            <br> <br>
                            Something peeked out of the sky. Its skewed body, scattered edges, and obscure being
                            mocked
                            me.
                            <br> <br>
                            "Does that look like a rabbit to you?"
                            <br> <br>
                            A strange yet comforting voice stole my senses. I wonder why I wasn't expecting company.
                            To
                            my side is a child whose attention could not be taken off the clouds.
                            <br> <br>
                            The hind legs make it look more like a hare than a rabbit.
                            <br> <br>
                            "Sure," I replied.
                            <br> <br>
                            I gazed beyond to find a thin, subtle yet paralysing stroke of violet bordering a thick
                            fiery cloud. With all its might, the sky, on fire, roared bright.
